# FinalApp
Final Personal Project for GUI S15

This app is designed to mimic the basic image feed functionality of Flickr. The app will display images from a hardcoded user name. Each result may be clicked to reveal a larger view of the image and image information.

The ideal user for this app is one looking for an image feed of only one user. It's designed to be as stripped down of an experience as possible.
